# Push_swap 
This project will make you sort data on a [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure-introduction-program/), with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

### What is push_swap?
Push_swap is an individual project at [42](42sp.org.br) that entails creating a program to sort a stack (stack A) using an auxiliary stack (stack B) with a specific set of commands: [sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, and rrr](#game-rules). The main challenge lies in implementing an algorithm that achieves sorting with the minimum possible number of operations.

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**

```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/gialexan/push_swap-42 && cd push_swap-42/
# Run make so you can build the library
make
# Execute your program
./push_swap 1 3 2 5 4
# Will output
pb
ra
pb
ra
sa
pa
pa
# Clean output objects with
make fclean
# Well done!
```
## Game rules
- The game is composed of 2 stacks named A and B.
- To start with: A contains randons numbers of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates. B is empty
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack A.
- To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th colspan=3><h4>Operations</h4></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>op</th>
			<th>description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	</thead>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">sa</td>
			<td>swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">sb</td>
			<td>swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">ss</td>
			<td>sa and sb at the same time.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">pa</td>
			<td>push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">pb</td>
			<td>push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">ra</td>
			<td>rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">rb</td>
			<td>rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">rr</td>
			<td>ra and rb at the same time.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">rra</td>
			<td>reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center">rrb</td>
			<td>reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</td>
		</tr>
